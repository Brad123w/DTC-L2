                The earth has lost its gravity


                Due to the earths long times of being abused and drilled into a massive series of earthquakes and eruptions in some countries. Meaning most of the world's population haze died people aware of this happening were able to save themselves with waits. There are some civilization's around the world with counter measures against the gravity. There are regular earthquakes from 5 to 8 magnitude with lots of after quakes. Thankfully we are still able to breathe in the world. Also government are trying to create a fake core bringing back the gravity. The Artic and oceans are floating round the world if you get stuck in water your dead
